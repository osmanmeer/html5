<h3>1. ABU BAKR AS-SIDDIQ RAA</h3>
<p>
Abu Bakr RAA is the best of all creation, after Ambiya. He was the closest companion of Prophet Muhammed PBUH. He is the first of the Rightly Guided caliphs. His original name was Abdul-Kaaba. After the advent of Islam, the Prophet gave him the name of Abdullah. His patronymic is Abu Bakr. He is known with the sobriquets of Jamiul Quran, as-Siddiq, and al-Atiq. The most famous of these is as-Siddiq.</p>
<p>
He was light-skinned with a lean body, a thin face, a sparse beard, deep-set eyes and a prominent forehead.</p>
<p>
Abu Bakr RAA was the first to enter Islam after Khadija RAA. He worked to gain converts to Islam powerful tribes during the Meccan period. On the other hand, he protected the helpless and slaves who were subject to torture by the idolaters, and he used his wealth to buy and free persecuted slaves.</p>
<p>
He was present at the battles of Badr, Uhud and the Ditch. He participated in military expeditions to Muraysi, Qurayza, Haybar, Mecca, Hunayn, and Taif.</p>
<p>
When Abu Bakr RAA became ill with a disease he got in Medina after the migration in the month of Jumada al-thani, 13 H., he wanted Umar RAA to lead the prayer. Consulting the Companions, he said he thought Umar RAA was suitable for the caliphate. He died at sixty-three like the Prophet PBUH whom he loved so much. According to his will, he was buried next to the Prophet PBUH at shoulder level.</p>
