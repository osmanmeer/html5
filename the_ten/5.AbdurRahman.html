    <h3>5. ABDURRAHMAN IBN AWF RAA</h3>
    <p>
        Abdurrahman RAA was born approximately twenty years after the Event of the Elephant. He entered Islam during the days of activity in Arkam's house. His name was given to him by the Prophet PBUH.
    </p>

    <p>
        He joined both migrations to Abyssinia. Eventually, when Muhammad PBUH encouraged the Companions to migrate to Medina, he did so with the others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Abdurrahman b. Awf RAA  began trading in the Medina market and Allah gave him great wealth. He is known as one of the most generous Companions of the Prophet PBUH.
    </p>

    <p>
        When he became very old during Uthman RAA's time, Abdurrahman RAA lived a very quiet life and finally died in Medina in the year 32 H.
    </p>

    <p>
        Abdurrahman b. Awf heard many hadiths the Prophet, but he refrained relating them all because of his scrupulousness. He has up to sixty-five hadiths narrated in hadith collections.
