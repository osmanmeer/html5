    <h3>4. Ali Ibn Abu Talib RAA</h3>
    <p>
        Ali RAA was the son of the Prophet PBUH's uncle, his son-in-law and the fourth Rightly Guided caliph. His father was Abu Talib, his mother was Fatima binti Asad the Quraish, and his grandfather was Abdulmuttalib. His patronymic was Abul Hasan and Abu Turab (father of earth), and his nickname was Haydar. His title was Commander of the Faithful. He is also referred to as "Allah's Lion."

    <p>
        Ali RAA was of short-medium height, with dark skin, large black eyes and a thick and broad beard.

        After Uthman RAA's martyrdom, prominent individuals pledged their allegiance to Ali RAA. When he became caliph he was confronted with many problems that needed to be solved. This confusion gave birth to internal conflict like Jemel and Siffin. Great sacrifice and effort were shown to resolve the disputes within the Islamic state.

        Eventually, in Kufa in the year 40 H. /661 A.D. Ali RAA was wounded by Abdurrahman ibn Muljam, a Hariji, as he was going to the morning prayer. He became a martyr as a result of this wound.

    <p>
        Because he was constantly at the side of the Prophet, he was advanced in Tafsir, Hadith and Fikh. In fact, in the Prophet's words he was the "gate to the city of knowledge," the most knowledgeable of the community.
