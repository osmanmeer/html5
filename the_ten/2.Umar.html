        Umar RAA was the second Rightly Guided caliph, he was one of the Companions closest to the Prophet PBUH in his struggle for Unity in an attempt to spread Islam and make it reign in this world. Umar's sobriquet was "Faruq," which means the one who discriminates between right and wrong.

        His father was Khattab b. Nufayl and his genealogy meets with the Prophet PBUH in Kab. A member of the Adiw branch of the Quraish tribe, his mother was Hanteme the sister or cousin of Abu Jahl.
