    <h3>10. ZUBAYR IBN AWWAM RAA</h3>
    <p>
        Zubayr ibn al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid ibn Asad ibn Abdil-Uzza ibn Qusayy ibn Qilab ibn Murra ibn Ka'b ibn Lueyy al-Qurasi al Asadi. He was called "Abu Abdullah" because of his oldest son Abdullah. Zubayr RAA was Prophet PBUH's friend, disciple and, at the same time, son of his aunt Safiyyah binti Abdulmuttalib.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Umar RAA's death, he was one of the 6-member council established to make the election of the caliph. His mother called him "Abu-t-Tahir." However, Zubayr was known by the patronymic of his son Abdullah.
    </p>

    <p>
        He was either the fourth or fifth Muslim. However, neither his date of birth nor the age at which he became Muslim is known for sure. He migrated to Abyssinia.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as he fought in all the battles, he played an important role in the conquest of Egypt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Zubayr RAA fought in the battle of Siffin; however, he later left the war. On the road to Medina when he came to water belonging to the Tamim tribe, Amr ibn Jarmouz began to follow him. He killed Zubayr at a place called the Siba Valley.
