    <h3>7. Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas RAA</h3>
    <p>
        Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas Malik ibn Wuhayb ibn Abdi Menaf ibn Zuhra. His father was Malik ibn Wuhayb. His patronymic being Abi Waqqas, Sa'd RAA was called Ibn Abi Waqqas due to it. Because the Prophet PBUH's mother was of Banu Zuhra, his genealogy meets Prophet PBUH on his mother's side. Sa'd RAA's mother was Hamene binti Sufyan ibn Umayya.
